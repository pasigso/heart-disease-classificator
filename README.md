A machine learning project to determine the existence of heart disease

Disclaimer:

The basis of the project belongs to the authors of the Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023 course (who authorize its distribution). However, this project is a modification of the author's original work that receives enough unpublished content (of my authorship) to be considered a unique project.

This project is solely for the purpose of demonstrating the author's capabilities in the use of machine learning and is in no way an entrepreneurial project.
